mu·sic ˈmyo͞ozik/ noun the science or art of ordering tones or sounds in succession, in combination, and in temporal relationships to produce a composition having unity and continuity [21st century archive, Merriam Webster.] reappropriated pre 24th century term encompassing the two media: feeling module and pattern composition or mod and comp. The 21st century genres have persisted, however it was not always this way in mod and comp.

The mod medium was not possible until the invention of the Palmer method, in which wireless terminal chips could safely be interfaced with the parietal lobe. With the new method terminal chips could access the entirety of the brain. The failing record company ASE started publishing albums with enhanced neuro definition [e.n.d. albums] that induced feelings in the listener through the Palmer enabled terminal chips. e.n.d. songs evolved to phase out the auditory input entirely and retain the narrative arc induction.

Unlike the mod medium, comp originated as media tangential to 22nd century music. The "pur rhyth" was an esoteric minor genre of music in the late 21st century that was later championed by the “pop” music genre who implemented scientifically engineered pleasure enducing content by appealing to the pattern recognition center of the temporal lobe. In a series of decades it began to resemble the Comp medium we know of in contemporium.
